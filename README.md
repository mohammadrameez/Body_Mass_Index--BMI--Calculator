# Body_Mass_Index--BMI--Calculator
In this project, I have developed a BMI calculator using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This user-friendly application allows users to quickly assess their Body Mass Index (BMI) to determine if they have a healthy weight for their height.

# Key Features:

- Input your height in Centimeter (cm) and your weight in kilogram (kg).
- It calculates BMI using the standard formula: BMI = weight (kg) / (height (m) * height (m)).
- Provides an instant BMI result and offers insights into your health and fitness.
- This project serves as an educational tool and a practical resource for anyone interested in monitoring their health and making informed decisions about their fitness goals. Feel free to explore the code, use it for reference, or contribute to its development. Your feedback and contributions are highly appreciated!

# BMI Categories
The BMI value is interpreted into the following categories:

- Underweight: BMI < 18.5
- Healthy: 18.5 ≤ BMI < 24.9
- Overweight: 24.9 ≤ BMI < 29.9
- Obese: BMI ≥ 30
